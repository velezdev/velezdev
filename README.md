### Hey hey 🙌🏼

🔭 I’m currently working as a freelance developer for clients that want to
elevate their web presence

🙋🏻 I’m back to software engineering after a 3-year break and looking to transition
to a full time role... and actively applying _now!_

🍄 I’m learning how to incorporate Nextjs v13+, React v18+ and Tailwind CSS in my future
projects
